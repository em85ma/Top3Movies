    <p class="movieDescription">If Cinderella was a true story, it would be very much like Ever After. Danielle
        D'Barbarac, is the strong, fiery daughter of a dead nobleman. She works as a servant to her stepmother, the
        Baroness D'Gent. One day Danielle pretends to be a courtier to help a servant escape from being taken to the
        Americas. She captures the eye of the most unlikely person, the crowned prince of France! The two fall in love,
        but they are up against the ruthless Baroness D'Gent, and her spoiled daughter, Marguerite who are determined to
        see that Margurite becomes Henry's bride. However with the servants, Danielle's kind stepsister, Jacqueline, and
        Leonardo Da Vinci on Danielle's side, Danielle and Prince Henry's love can survive even though he is a prince
        and she is a servant girl.</p>
